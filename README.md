# EmployeeManager App

This app implements CRUD operations with employee management scenario. I have used H2 database which is in-memory database. For Frontend, I have used Angular and for backend I have used Spring Boot.

# Usage
1) Download both Frontend and Backend module
2) In Backend, add respective username and password for database and save it
3) You can view the data store using following url ``` http://localhost:9001/h2-console ```
4) Next install all required dependencies in Frontend using ``` npm i ```
4) Now run the project using ``` ng serve ```
